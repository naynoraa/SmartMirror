# First Milestone: Setting Up
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my monitor and installing the Smart Mirror program. In order to get the Rasberry pi working, I had to first download the Raspbewrry Pi software and upload it to a USB, which I then used plugged into my Rapberry Pi. From there, I hooked up the monitor and keyboard and mouse, allowing me to finally edit my smart mirror. Here, I ran intto a few roadblocks, the main one being getting used to the foreign UI and coding language used. Fortunately, I was able to figure it out and see how my smart mirror looks!
